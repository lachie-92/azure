                    NeuroActiv&trade; provides key nutrients to support essential metabolic pathways in the Central 
                    Nervous System (CNS) for healthy brain function, healthy mood and healthy cognitive function. 
                    Vitamins B6, B12 and folate support the methylation of proteins, membrane phospholipids, and 
                    metabolism of neurotransmitters in the CNS. Vitamin B6 is an essential co-factor in the synthesis 
                    of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), noradrenaline and 
                    melatonin. Low plasma levels of vitamins B6, B12 and folate have been associated with elevated 
                    homocysteine levels, impaired neurotransmitter synthesis, mild cognitive decline, and a range of 
                    neurological symptoms. NeuroActiv&trade; provides a therapeutic dose of Ubiquinol-10, the reduced 
                    form of coenzyme Q10, with a superior absorption profile and higher bioavailability compared to 
                    ubiquinone. Coenzyme Q10 is essential for mitochondrial energy production. Coenzyme Q10 provides 
                    upport for the high energy requirements in the brain, and may offer neuroprotective support for 
                    conditions associated with impaired mitochondrial function.
