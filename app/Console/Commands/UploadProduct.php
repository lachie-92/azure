                            Lactoferrin is naturally found in colostrum and human milk and is a component of the

                            Immunoglobulins (Ig) are protein molecules that function as antibodies against many
                            pathogenic and potentially pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses.

                            for the development of an effective immune response against a large range of microorganisms

                            Immunoglobulins (Ig) are protein molecules that function as antibodies against many
