                    Lactoferrin is a naturally occurring glycoprotein found in mucosal secretions, human milk and
                    colostrum. It is a component of the innate immune response and protects against a variety of
                    pathogens. Lactoferrin provides anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activity, and may help to
                    reduce inflammatory lesions associated with mild-moderate acne vulgaris.

                    Bonolive速 is a clinically trialled extract of olive leaf. Intake of Bonolive速 has been shown to
                    lead to excellent bioavailabilty of bioactive metabolites in pharmacokinetic research. Bonolive速
                    has been shown to promote bone health by stimulating osteoblast growth in a clinical study.
                    Olive leaf extract has been found to exhibit broad spectrum antimicrobial properties against
                    viruses and bacteria in vitro.
