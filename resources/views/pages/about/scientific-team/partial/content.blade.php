                        Rachel Manuel completed a PhD in 2013 from the University of Claude Bernard, Lyon (France). She examined the implication of a collagen-derived fragment in tumor growth and angiogenesis regulation. Her present research work at Medlab focuses on the&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>&nbsp;effects of probiotic strains.&nbsp; The purpose of this research is to examine their ability to restore the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier, which is impaired in CKD patients.
