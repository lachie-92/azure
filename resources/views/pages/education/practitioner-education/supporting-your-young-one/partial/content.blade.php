                        The microbiome evolves within a healthy host from birth to death, constantly re-adjusting to maintain
                        a homeostatic balance with the host&#39;s immune system. Continued evolution of the human microbiome after
                        birth is governed by host factors such as both the adaptive and innate immune system and external
                        factors such as diet, medication, environmental exposure&#39;s and illness. It was previously believed that
                        the in utero environment was sterile and that an infant is exposed to the bacterial assault during the
                        birthing process.<sup>1</sup> This notion has now been debunked. Colonization of the mucosa in the digestive,
                        respiratory, urogenital tracts and the skin likely occurs before the time of birth when a newborn is
                        exposed to the mother&#39;s microbiota.  Recent studies suggest the presence of a microbiome within the
                        placenta and foetal meconium with exposure to antenatal sources of commensal bacterial and the seeding
                        of the infant varying by length of gestation. This would help explain the variations in bacterial
                        colonization between full-term and pre-term infants.<sup>1</sup>

                        The mode of delivery and whether an infant is breast or bottle fed plays a major role on early
                        colonization patterns of the neonatal gut microbiota, with breast milk containing its own microbiome
                        but also mediators that can direct inflammatory responses to pathogens in the gut (see table 1). The
                        infant gastrointestinal microbial profile is relatively simple in contrast to that of adults and is
                        unstable until the age of approximately 3 years when it establishes its adult form. During this time
                        many factors have considerable effect on the composition and determination of the microbial
                        community.<sup>1,2</sup> Even after the microbiome is well established in healthy infants, dysbiosis, or shifts
                        in microbial composition or diversity, can occur in the setting of dietary changes, antibiotic exposure
                        or infection. Dysbiotic conditions can favour invasion and growth of pathogenic species and can disrupt
                        the finely tuned regulatory circuits of the immune system that maintain a system of pro- and
                        anti-inflammatory checks and balances.The manipulation of the infant microbiota with the use of
                        pre- and probiotics can have a significant impact with long lasting results.<sup>1</sup>

                        Clinical evidence from a recent Cochrane Review conclude that the use of multi-species probiotics from
                        the <em>Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus</em> genera have unequivocally demonstrated clinical
                        evidence for preventing severe necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and all cause mortality in preterm
                        infants, to which the authors concluded that the evidence strongly supports a change in practice.<sup>3</sup>
                        <em>Saccharomyces boulardii</em> has been extensively researched for the treatment of diarrhoea in both children
                        and adults and has shown a clinically significant benefit in reducing duration of acute infectious
                        diarrhoea in children by up to 24 hours and mean hospital stay by 36 hours. The percentage of
                        diarrhoea-free children in the <em>Saccharomyces</em> group was significantly larger after 48 and 72 hours when
                        compared to the control group.<sup>4</sup> Furthermore, <em>S. boulardii</em> stimulates host innate immune responses to
                        pathogens via secretory IgA release, stimulates small intestinal release of digestive enzymes, produces
                        anti-inflammatory molecules and secretes polyamines that regulate host gene expression and protein
                        synthesis.<sup>5</sup>

                        Breast milk oligosaccharides selectively nourish <em>Bifidobacterium</em> microbiota with species such as
                        <em>Bifidobacterium infantis</em> being isolated from breast-fed infants.  <em>B. infantis</em> colonizes the infant
                        gut mucosal lining assisting with pathogen elimination, improving epithelial tight junction homeostasis
                        decreasing  gut permeability and inducing host anti-inflammatory cytokine production. <em>Bifidobacteria
                            infantis</em> is a natural commensal isolated from breast-fed infants.<sup>6</sup> <em>Bifidobacterium longum</em> is a common

                    <p>
                        Lactoferrin is the second most abundant protein in human breast milk, and is also secreted in tears,
                        saliva, intestinal mucus, genital secretions and in granules of neutrophils. It is a glycoprotein
                        belonging to the transferrin family of iron-binding proteins. As a multifunctional protein it
                        demonstrates potent anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity
                        providing a defence mechanism for the mammalian body.  The bactericidal effect of lactoferrin is in
                        part due to its ability to bind iron that is essential for pathogenic bacterial growth resulting in
                        bacteriostasis. Furthermore, lactoferrin disrupts the integrity of pathogenic bacterial cell walls by
                        binding to lipopolysaccharides causing cell wall degradation.<sup>7</sup> Clinical evidence from a recent Cochrane
                        Review demonstrated the therapeutic activity of lactoferrin for the prevention of sepsis and NEC in
                        preterm infants.<sup>8</sup>

                        Prebiotics are selectively fermented compounds, naturally produced in the body or provided in the diet,
                        that promote specific beneficial effects to the composition and activity of the gastrointestinal
                        microbiota. Prebiotics in breast milk consist of milk glycans comprising free oligosaccharides,
                        glycoproteins and glycolipids that drive the health of the infant gut.<sup>9</sup> Dietary sources of prebiotics
                        include oligosaccharides, inulin and resistant starches. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis
                        concluded that available evidence suggests that the preventative use of prebiotics decreases the rate
                        of infections requiring antibiotic therapy in infants and children aged 0-24 months with one study
                        indicating that prebiotics may also be effective in decreasing the rate of overall infections.<sup>10</sup>
                        Furthermore, a recent Cochrane Review found that there is some evidence that a prebiotic supplement
                        added to infant feeds may prevent eczema, however further research is needed.<sup>11</sup>
