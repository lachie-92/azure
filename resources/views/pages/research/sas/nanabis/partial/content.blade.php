                            Chances are you have come to this page because a patient presented to you has a MED IDENT
                            bracelet on his or her wrist. A bracelet is provided with the investigational product to
                            every patient, and its strongly recommended that the patient wear these at all times.
                            Should the patient misplace or damage their bracelet, Medlab will be happy to replace at no charge.
