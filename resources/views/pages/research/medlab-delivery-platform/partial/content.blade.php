                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Nanotechnology converts fat-soluble and poorly water-soluble compounds into highly
                        water-soluble particles. This process creates a clear aqueous solution of these nutrients in
                        high concentrations. This results in very stable nutrient preparations that greatly enhance
                        their absorption and also the rate at which they are absorbed.<sup>1</sup> This in particular
                        allows absorption across the oral mucosal lining as opposed to intestinal absorption.

                        Medlab has achieved a successful world first lodgement for a patent application pertaining to
                        a unique delivery system that converts such compounds into nanosized particles, certified to
                        measure less than 0.2 microns. Nano-formulations, by virtue of their size, are known for
                        circumventing the obstacles of poor pharmacokinetics. The resulting aqueous solubility of the
                        compound ensures its transport across the cellular membrane. This patented technology will be
                        applied to both nutritional and pharmaceutical compounds in the near future.

                        Our research demonstrates that nanotechnology increases plasma and serum levels of fat-soluble
                        nutrients up to 3 times more than emulsions and up to 5 times more than oil preparations in
                        healthy participants (Fig 1). Furthermore, the absorption rate of the nanoparticles is 200%
                        more than that of an emulsion formulation and 370% more than an oil preparation (Fig 2).

                        Emulsions typically consist of at least 2 immiscible liquids (usually oil and water) with one
                        of the liquids being dispersed as small spherical droplets into the other. Emulsions are
                        thermodynamically unfavourable systems that tend to break down over time due to a variety of
                        physiochemical mechanisms including gravitational separation, flocculation, coalescence and
                        change of structure.<sup>3</sup>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Conventional oil-in-water emulsions do not produce water-soluble particles (Fig 3); they remain
                        water-insoluble and thus still require efficient processing by the body to create particles
                        that are able to be absorbed across the mucosal epithelium of the small and large intestine.
                        Our nanotechnology creates water-soluble aqueous solutions (Fig4).
