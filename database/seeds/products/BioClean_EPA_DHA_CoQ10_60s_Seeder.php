                    Omega-3 Fatty Acids are essential nutrients that are incorporated into all cellular membranes,
                    improving cell function and integrity.  The formulation contains Coenzyme Q10, also a vital
                    nutrient required for the regulation of cellular and tissue function particularly those of
                    the cardiovascular and neurocognitive systems with elevated metabolic need.  Ubiquinol, the
                    reduced form of CoQ10, has a superior absorption profile and higher bioavailability than
                    other forms, therefore increasing therapeutic efficacy.  Together this has created an advanced
                    formulation to support cardiovascular and neurocognitive health and function.

                    <strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids and the Cardiovascular System</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Important fats that enhance the functional physiology of the cardiovascular system are
                    alpha–linolenic acid (ALA), the parent compound of the omega–3 fatty acid family, and
                    linoleic acid (LA), the parent compound of the omega–6 family. ALA and LA are essential
                    fatty acids obtained from the diet, as they cannot be synthesised. Omega–3 fatty acids
                    consist of the long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
                    and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that are of marine origin with oily fish being the richest
                    dietary source.<sup>1</sup>Omega-3 fatty acids have important physiological properties that
                    include anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic properties.<sup>2</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Numerous reviews have summarised the cardiovascular benefits of fish and fish oil consumption
                    in the primary<sup>3</sup> and secondary<sup>4</sup> prevention of cardiovascular conditions.
                    Research on nutrient intakes has shown that regular consumption of omega-3 fats significantly
                    lowers heart-disease risk.<sup>3,4</sup> For example, a report of a cohort from the Nurses
                    Health Study<sup>5</sup> showed that women who ate two-to-four servings of fish a week
                    reduced heart disease risk by 30 per cent. Further, it has been shown that omega–3s reduce
                    blood pressure and heart rate, lower blood triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol, and
                    make blood less likely to form clots and create life-threatening thromboses.<sup>5</sup>

                <p>
                    As a predominant structural component of neural membranes in the brain and retina, DHA has
                    demonstrated to have a positive effect on membrane fluidity and permeability, receptor
                    structure and quantity, carrier mediated transport of nutrients into and out of the cell,
                    enzymatic activities, cell to cell communication and signaling as well as the microenvironment
                    of retinal photoreceptor outer segments.<sup>6,7</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHA has been reported to be of significant importance for foetal brain development, for the
                    optimal development of visual acuity and overall motor skills in infants, to help maintain
                    healthy and balanced lipid metabolism in children and adults, and to support cognition in
                    the elderly.<sup>8</sup> In the area of anti-ageing medicine, essential fatty-acids, in
                    particular the omega-3 long-chain PUFAs, are also increasingly being investigated as
                    therapeutic agents with potential to limit the cognitive decline that accompanies the ageing
                    brain. Furthermore, during ageing, there is also a decrease in brain levels of DHA, and the
                    consumption of fish correlates with a decreased risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
                    The reported daily use of fish-oil supplements, although limited in evidence status,
                    suggests a possible association between omega–3 fatty acids and reduced risk of
                    dementia.<sup>9,10</sup>

                    <strong>Coenzyme Q10 as Ubiquinol for Cardiovascular Health</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is nothing more critical for all anabolic and catabolic cellular functions than an adequate,
                    constant supply of bioenergy.<sup>11</sup> Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) plays a central role in cellular
                    bioenergy generation and its regulation. Closed membrane systems generate a proton motive force to
                    create transient localized bio-capacitors; the captured energy is used for the synthesis of
                    mitochondrial ATP but also for many other processes, such as metabolite translocations, nerve
                    conduction and a host of other bioenergy requiring processes. Coenzyme Q10 plays a key role
                    in many of these sub-cellular membrane energy generating systems. Integral to this phenomenon
                    is the prooxidant role of coenzyme Q10 in generating the major superoxide anion/hydrogen
                    peroxide second messenger system.<sup>11</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A recent review has reported that with advancing age there is a major risk factor for the
                    development of cardiovascular conditions.<sup>12</sup> Moreover that the aetiology of several
                    cardiovascular disorders are thought to involve impaired mitochondrial function and metabolic
                    dysfunction and more importantly of mitochondrial loss (mytophagy and autophagy).<sup>13</sup>
                    CoQ10 acts as both an antioxidant and as a pro-oxidant at the level of the
                    mitochondria.<sup>11</sup> Furthermore, in patients with cardiac conditions, plasma
                    CoQ10 has been found to be an independent predictor of mortality. Based on the fundamental
                    role of CoQ10 in mitochondrial bioenergetics and its well-acknowledged metabolic promoting
                    properties, several clinical trials evaluating CoQ10 have been undertaken in cardiovascular
                    disorders of ageing including chronic heart failure, hypertension and endothelial
                    dysfunction.<sup>12</sup>
